Title: Bioinformatics: some easy wins and a roadmap to competency.

There are some concepts which are essential for building bioinformatic skills but which are rarely covered - or mentioned - in a biology degree. These are file systems, working directories, paths and computational workflow, and not knowing about them makes learning any bioinformatics really hard! In this talk I will explain what these are before giving you an overview of the core ideas and key steps which are common to a variety of bioinformatic analyses. Finally, I'll share some tips and resources for competency.

0 to 45 minutes talk based on your knowledge of bioinformatics for people who donâ€™t use bioinformatics tools regularly but will need it with the progress of their PhD.

talk about your specific research or any tool you consider significant to learn about.
