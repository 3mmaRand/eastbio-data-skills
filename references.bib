 doi={10.18637/jss.v059.i10},
 abstract={A huge amount of effort is spent cleaning data to get it ready for analysis, but there has been little research on how to make data cleaning as easy and effective as possible. This paper tackles a small, but important, component of data cleaning: data tidying. Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and visualize, and have a specific structure: each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table. This framework makes it easy to tidy messy datasets because only a small set of tools are needed to deal with a wide range of un-tidy datasets. This structure also makes it easier to develop tidy tools for data analysis, tools that both input and output tidy datasets. The advantages of a consistent data structure and matching tools are demonstrated with a case study free from mundane data manipulation chores.},

  abstract  = "ABSTRACTSpreadsheets are widely used software tools for data
               entry, storage, analysis, and visualization. Focusing on the
               data entry and storage aspects, this article offers practical
               recommendations for organizing spreadsheet data to reduce errors
               and ease later analyses. The basic principles are: be
               consistent, write dates like YYYY-MM-DD, do not leave any cells
               empty, put just one thing in a cell, organize the data as a
               single rectangle (with subjects as rows and variables as
               columns, and with a single header row), create a data
               dictionary, do not include calculations in the raw data files,
               do not use font color or highlighting as data, choose good names
               for things, make backups, use data validation to avoid data
               entry errors, and save the data in plain text files.",
