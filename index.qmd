## Summary

- who am i

- background

- no one wants to learn to code


There are some concepts which are essential for building bioinformatic skills but which are rarely covered - or mentioned - in a biology degree. 
-   file systems, 
-   working directories, paths and 
-   computational workflow, 

and not knowing about them makes learning any bioinformatics really hard! In this talk I will explain what these are before giving you an overview of the core ideas and key steps which are common to a variety of bioinformatic analyses. Finally, I'll share some tips and resources for competency.

So cruel! Who did collect the data? I will sack them!\" Person at the computer: \"um...I did, 3 years ago\""}
