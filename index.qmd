## About me

-   Teach data analysis and reproducibility in analytic pipelines predominantly to those who do not see themselves as programmers

-   Training Early Career Researchers  

-   Encourage people to code

-   Promote programming competence as learned, not innate





# Why script?


## Reproducibility is key!


-   *"... obtaining consistent results using the same input data; computational steps, methods, and code; and conditions of analysis."*. [@nationalacademiesofsciences2019]

Also see 

-   The Turing Way "Definitions for Reproducibility"  [@community2022]



## Reproducibility is key!


[![The Turing Way\'s definitions of reproducible research

Each of cells contain one of the definitions for reproducibility"}](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/overview/overview-definitions#rr-overview-definitions)




## You are your first collaborator!

The person at the computer replies 'Can't understand the date...and the data collector does not answer my emails or calls' Person offstage: 'That's terrible! So cruel! Who did collect the data? I will sack them!' Person at the computer: 'um...I did, 3 years ago.'"

## Why does it matter?

-   Five selfish reasons to work reproducibly [@markowetz2015].
    Alternatively, see the very entertaining
    [talk](https://youtu.be/yVT07Sukv9Q)

-   Many high profile cases of work which did not reproduce e.g. Anil
    Potti unravelled by @baggerly2009

-   **Will** become standard in Science and publishing e.g OECD Global
    Science Forum Building digital workforce capacity and skills for
    data-intensive science [@oecdglobalscienceforum2020]

## It's science!

## You are not alone!


"*Nobody wants to learn to code. They just want to kick ass*."

## I don't do *any* coding...


..and I'm not about to start!



You can still make steps towards reproducibility

-   Organise your data [@JSSv059i10; @Broman2018-vt]

-   Describe your data with metadata

-   Use a Project-oriented workflow with file and folder structure

-   Name things carefully

## Organise your data



## Metadata



## Project-oriented workflow

-   use folders to organise your work

-   you are aiming for structured, systematic and repeatable.

-   inputs and outputs should be clearly identifiable from structure
    and/or naming

## Example

```         
-- liver_transcriptome/
   |__data
      |__raw/
      |__processed/
   |__images/
   |__code/
   |__reports/
   |__figures/
```

## Naming things

![documents, CC-BY-NC,

## Naming things

Guiding principle - Have a convention! Good file names are:

-   machine readable

-   human readable

-   play nicely with sorting

## I suggest

-   no spaces in names

-   use snake_case or kebab-case rather than CamelCase or dot.case

-   use all lower case except very occasionally where convention is
    otherwise, e.g., README, LICENSE

-   ordering: use left-padded numbers e.g., 01, 02....99 or 001,
    002....999

-   dates [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format:
    2020-10-16

-   write down your conventions

      |__raw/
